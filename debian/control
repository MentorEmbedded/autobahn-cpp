Description: WAMP in C++ for Boost/Asio - development headers
 Autobahn|Cpp provides an implementation of the WebSocket and Web
 Application Messaging (WAMP) protocols.
 .
 WebSocket allows bidirectional real-time messaging on the Web and
 WAMP adds asynchronous Remote Procedure Calls and Publish &
 Subscribe on top of WebSocket.
 .
 Autobahn|Cpp is open-source, licensed under the Boost Software
 License. The API and implementation make use of modern C++ 11 and
 new asynchronous idioms using (upcoming) features of the standard
 C++ library, in particular Futures, Continuations and Lambdas.
 .
 This package includes the header files
